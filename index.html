        Ling Tan was born and raised in a Chinese coffee-shop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At the age of twenty-one, she left for Hawaii on a scholarship to the East-West Center, later switching between New York City and K.L. before settling down in Guatemala. For the last three decades, she has made her home by Lake Atitlan, fully immersed in the community where she raised a son, a daughter and a restaurant. A demographer by training, a restaurateur by vocation, an empty nester by timing, fluent in five languages, Ling balances her days with writing, painting, qigong, yoga, choir-singing, and playing the ukulele.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Her work has been published in Anak Sastra and in two anthologies, Cultural Fusions and On the Back of a Motorbike. She is currently at work on a memoir, “Lingo: a memoir in A-Z”.
